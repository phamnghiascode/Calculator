I'm excited to share my very first project using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) - a calculator! This project has been a rewarding journey of learning the fundamentals of WPF development and applying them to create a functional and user-friendly application.

**Key Features:**

* Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Potentially includes more advanced calculations (depending on your implementation)
* User-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and other functions (clear, equals, etc.)
* Visually appealing design (tailored to your preferences)

**Learning Experience:**

* Working with WPF concepts like controls and event handling
* Understanding the XAML markup language for defining the application's UI
* Writing C# code to implement the calculator's logic and functionality
